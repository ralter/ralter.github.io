    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
    Hi all, my name is Reuben. I currently study Applied Mathematics at Colorado College.
    I figured it was worth tossing some information about me online. My current interests are primarily in the field of Computational math - lots of interest in numerical PDE's, Bayesian statistics, etc. I'm still fairly new in the field and thus have curiousity in nearly every direction a la applied math. 


    Outside of math, I work at the National Center for Atmospheric Research on open-source weather sensing with the 
<a href="https://ncar.github.io/openiotwx/" target="_blank">OpenIoTwx</a> team and at CC's GIS center, mostly focusing on remote sensing and parallelizing geospatial analysis workflows.

    Most of my time outside of academics and work is fanatically devoted to the outdoors - Ultrarunning, backcountry skiing, climbing.
